Predicting Heart disease using Machine Learning algorithms
This report tells discusses various Python-based ML and Data Science libraries in
an attempt to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether or not
someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem Definition
2. Retrieving Data
3. Understanding Features
4. Data Preparation and its tools
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Modelling
7. Model Evaluation

1. Problem Definition
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have
heart disease?
Our aim is to reach the model accuracy of more than 85% . If the model scores
better than 85%, we will select the model

2. Retrieving Data
The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository and also a version of it available on Kaggle.
